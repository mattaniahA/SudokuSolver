# SudokuSolver
Sudoku Solver that implements constraint satisfaction problems concepts such as variable ordering, backtracking search methods and forward checking. This program test several heuristics to improve the performance of the original Sudoku solver originally derived from a C++ implementation at http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-set-7-suduku/

# Variable Order Heuristics
1. Static Ordering = MyOriginalStaticOrderingOpt2()
2. Random Ordering = MyOriginalRandomOrderingOpt3()
3. Minimum Remaining Value = MyMinRemainingValueOrderingOpt4()
4. Maximum Remaining Value = MyMaxRemainingValueOrderingOpt5()
